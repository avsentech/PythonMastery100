    Concept             Description
    ------------------------------
    Variable            Stores values in the memory
    Arithmetic          Adds two numbers
    Output              Displays result using print()    
"""

# How the Logic Works
"""
    - Assign values to a and b
    - Calculate their sum
    - Print the result

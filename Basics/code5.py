# Code #5: Loops
# Tier: Basic
# Goal: Print numbers 1 through 5

for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)

# Concept Breakdown
"""
    Concept     Description
    ------------------------
    Loop        Repeats action for defined range
    Range       Creates sequence from 1 to 5
    Output      Displays each number
"""

# How the Logic Works
"""
    - Use a for loop over range 1 to 5
    - Print each number during iteration
"""

# Flowchart-Like Visualization
"""
    [Start]
    ↓
    for i in range(1,6):
    → Print i
    → Repeat
    [End]
"""

# Real-World Connection
"""
    - Foundational for automating repetitive tasks: reporting, batch processing, simulation
    - Used in data pipelines and file operation

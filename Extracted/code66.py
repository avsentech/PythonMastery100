# Code #66: Demonstrate Method Overriding with Shape Hierarchy
"""
    ðŸ§  Why This Matters?
    Used in:
    - ðŸŽ¨ Drawing libraries (e.g. turtle, graphics engines)
    - ðŸ§® Geometry calculators and CAD software
    - ðŸ§± Strategy and plugin design patterns
    - ðŸ§¬ Polymorphism + inheritance in one elegant bundl

# Concept Breakdown
"""
    Concept             Description
    --------------------------------
    Shape class         Defines generic interface
    area() method       Overridden in each subclass
    Polymorphism        Same method name, different logic
    __class__.__name__  Dynamically prints current shape type
"""
# Each subclass provides its own implementation of area()--overriding the base method.

# Code #82: Find All Subsets of a List Using Recursion
"""
    ðŸ§  Why This Matters?
    Used in:
    - ðŸ“Š Data mining and feature selection
    - ðŸŽ¯ Strategy planning and decision trees
    - ðŸ§® Power set generation in discrete math
    - ðŸ§ª Testing all combinations in simulation

# Tier: Intermediate
# Goal: Generate all possible subsets (the power set) of a given list using recursive branching

# Concept Breakdown
"""
    Concept             Description
    --------------------------------
    Base Case           If list is empty, return [[]]
    Recursive Case      Build subsets from rest, then add first
    [subset + [first]]  Combines current element with existing subset
    Power Set           Includes all combinations from 0 to n items
"""
# Output grows as 2^n for a list of n elements - so recursion depth scales quickly.

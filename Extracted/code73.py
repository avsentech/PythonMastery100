# Code #73: Handle File Not Found Exception Gracefully
"""
    ðŸ§  Why This Matters?
    Used in:
    - ðŸ§¾ Reading logs or config files that may not exist
    - ðŸ“¦ Error-proof file operations in real-world systems
    - ðŸ“„ CLI tools or API readers working with user-uploaded file
"""
# Tier: Beginner
# Goal: Attempt to read a file that might not exist, and respond with a user-friendly message

# Python Code
filename = "missing.txt"

try:
    with open(filename, "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
        print("File Content:\n", content)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: '{filename}' doesnot exists.")

# Output (if file is missing)
"""
    Error: 'missing.txt' does not exist.

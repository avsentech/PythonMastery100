# Goal: Move all disks from source to target using an auxilary peg, following these rules:
"""
    - Only one disk can be moved at a time.
    - A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller one.
    - Only topmost disk from any peg can be moved.

# Concept Breakdown

    Concept             Description
    --------------------------------
    Recursive Divide    Break problem into subproblems (n-1 disks)
    Base Case           Move single disk directly
    Order Matters       Recursion builds move order precisely
    Pegs                Abstract labels for source/target/auxiliary

# Tier: Beginner
# Goal: Open an existing file and safely add new content at the end

# Python Code
filename = "example.txt"
new_line = "This is an appended entry"

with open(filename, "a") as file:
    file.write(f"\n{new_line}")

print("New data appended successfully.")

# Output

    .write()                Adds data to the end of file
    \n newline              Ensures entry starts on a fresh line
    with block              Automatically handles file closing
"""
# You can append multiple entries in a loop or log timestamps alongside the text.

# Code #99: Use collections.Counter for Word Frequency
# Tier: Intermediate
# Goal: Count how often each word appears in a text

# Python Code
from collections import Counter
import re

def get_word_frequency(text):
    # Clean and tokenize the text

    text = text.lower()
    words = re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', text)    # matches words (alphanumeric)

    # Count frequency
    word_counts = Counter(words)

    # Disply results

    print("ðŸ”¤ Word Frequencies:")
    for word, count in word_counts.most_common():
        print(f"{word}: {count}")

# Sample Usage
